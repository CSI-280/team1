                1.) Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets<br></br>
                2.) Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North

                From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that 
                best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover 
                what services it offers. Petfinder also includes discussion forums, a pet-care resource
                directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes.
